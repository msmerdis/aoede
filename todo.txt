1. validate composite id's - missing element from composite id results to null pointer exception

Given prepare composite id "sectionId"
	|   sheetId | integer | 1000 |
	|   trackId | integer | 1000 |
When update "section" with composite id "sectionId"
	| tempo         | integer     |       120      |
	| keySignature  | integer     |        0       |
	| timeSignature | fraction    |       3/4      |
Then the request was not successful
And the response has a status code of 400
And the response contains "nullValidationInfo" objects in "validations"
	| name          | field   | value | error                          |
	| updateSection | trackId |       | Section must define a track id |

2. verify if parent element exists - currently throws a conflict error
